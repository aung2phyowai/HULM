# HULM (Hidden-Unit Logistic Model)
This is the implementation of the hidden-unit logistic model, which is proposed in the following paper:  
Wenjie Pei, Hamdi DibeklioÄŸlu, David M.J. Tax, Laurens van der Maaten. "Multivariate Time Series Classification using the Hidden-Unit Logistic Model", IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2017. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7835652/

Please Note:
1. the code which is computataionally expensive is written in cmex. Before playing around the code, please first run compile_cmex.m to compile the cmex code. 
2. We only provide some of the datasets with relative size due to the uploading limitation of github.
